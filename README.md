Magic: the Gathering Product Generator

This is the repository for the online app I initially created for generating prerelease boosters as a sort of prerelease simulator.

The original (and live) app is here: http://mtgen.net

My future plan is to create a proper database for this project, along with letting people share their generated sets, a deck builder, etc.

With current version, each new set is a copy of the old set updated to fix any bugs, add new features, change the theme, and change the cards.
