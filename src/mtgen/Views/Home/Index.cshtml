    <p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>
    <p>This site exists because I'm not a very good Magic player. Really I only play during the prereleases, and I've half-forgotten the rules every time. It takes me forever to build my deck, and my poor friends need to use some of their time to help me out. That's not really cool. So to help me, thank them, and hopefully help others, I present to you my crappy thrown-together-in-a-Saturday-afternoon MtG Card Generator!</p>
    <p>Well, I've evolved it considerably since it started. But that's how it started.</p>
    <p>The idea is to let it generate, using a hopefully <em>somewhat</em> accurate algorithm, what you're get at a <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases">MtG Prerelease</a> event. Then you can take your time, check out the cards, try to remember the rules, and maybe figure out what deck you'd build.</p>
    <p>I enjoy building and enhancing this thing, so I'll try to keep doing it for every new set.</p>
    <p>Technically these Prereleases use a format called <a href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/sw63">Sealed Deck</a>, where you get 6 packs of sealed boosters, open them, and construct your deck from only those cards.</p>

    <p>12-Nov-2014: This project has now been <a href="https://github.com/copperdogma/mtgen">open sourced on Github</a>. I will continue creating new generators as new sets come out, but if you have something you wish to contribute I'd love to hear from you. Enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Sealed Deck Generator Sets</h2>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr><th></th><th>Set</th><th>Generator Created Date</th><th>Prerelease Date</th><th>Release Date</th></tr>
        </thead>
        @foreach (var set in sets)
        {
            @if (set.IsBlockSet)
            {
                <tbody class="block">
                    <tr class="title"><td colspan="5">@set.Block</td></tr>
                    @foreach (var blockSet in set.BlockSets)
                    {
                        @Component.Invoke("SetSummary", blockSet)
                    }
                </tbody>
            }
            else
            {
                @Component.Invoke("SetSummary", set)
            }
        }
    </table>

    <p>Where are the previous sets? I started the generator on Innistrad, so older ones don't exist. I may add them one day. If you have a particular set you really want to see, <a href="mailto:cam.marsollier@gmail.com">let me know</a>.</p>
